He starts by cutting a lime with a knife and placing ice into a glass. Next, he pours a green spirit into the glass, adds mint leaves, and gently muddles the mint to release its oils. The man stirs and shakes the ingredients using a silver shaker, demonstrating precise cocktail mixing skills. Additionally, he carefully pours a colorless liquid into another glass with ice and mint leaves. Finally, he juices a lime into the mixed drink, ensuring all elements are well-combined before presenting the cocktail to the camera."

The spacious court has vibrant green flooring contrasted against plain white walls. Two teams, each consisting of multiple players in gray jerseys, are energetically engaged in gameplay. The game commences with two boys from one team swiftly approaching the center line to grab balls and throw them at the opposing team. After making their throws, they retreat to their side. Following this, the other team advances, with a player in a purple t-shirt standing out, successfully hitting an opponent with a ball. The teams take turns advancing to the center to throw, swiftly returning to their positions, maintaining a quick pace. Off the court, individuals assist by providing and collecting balls for the players, who continuously aim to hit opponents while dodging incoming throws. The gameplay continues with strategic throws and dodges until the end of the video."
